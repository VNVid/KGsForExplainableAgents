# Knowledge Graphs for xAI Conversational Agents

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and framework for integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into Explainable AI (xAI) Conversational Agents. The project explores the role of KGs in enhancing transparency, reliability, and adaptability in conversational systems. It includes:
- A systematic literature review.
- A proposed framework for combining KGs and conversational AI.
- An example implementation demonstrating the framework's efficacy.

## Features
- **Explainability and Transparency**: Utilizes KGs to provide interpretable and reliable responses.
- **Adaptable Framework**: Supports various conversational AI architectures.
- **Practical Demonstration**: A working prototype using Neo4j and Large Language Models (LLMs).
